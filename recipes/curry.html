        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil; partially cook the cauliflower, potatoes, and garlic cloves in the boiling water for 5 to 7 minutes. Drain. Spread into the bottom of the prepared casserole dish; season with salt and pepper. Scatter the peas over the mixture. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine the vegetable stock, butter, and flour together in a small saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Slowly stir the milk into the mixture; continue cooking until hot. Slowly add the Swiss cheese to the mixture and allow to melt into the liquid; cook and stir until a cheesy white sauce forms. Season with the curry powder, salt, and pepper. Pour the sauce over the vegetable mixture. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the vegetables are cooked through and tender, about 20 minutes. Serve hot.</li>
